A vscode extension for TypeScript files that offers refactoring options that I felt was missing.

## Features

A number of refactoring options will be offered via the vscode quick fix lightbulb feature, and available as commands if you wish to keybind stuff.
See below for a complete listing, expand each one for demo.
